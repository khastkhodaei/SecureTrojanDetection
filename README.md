# Secure Trojan Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement a secure Trojan detection system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes hardware-related data to detect the presence of Trojans in integrated circuits, enhancing the security of computer systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various hardware-related data files:
- `HEROdata2.csv`: Main dataset containing hardware-related features.
- `data_1.csv`, `data_2.csv`, ..., `data_5.csv`: Additional datasets for experimentation and testing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khastkhodaei/secure-trojan-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd secure-trojan-detection

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Trojan Detection (trojan_detection.py)
- Run the trojan_detection.py script to perform Trojan detection using machine learning models:
   ```bash
   python trojan_detection.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to train and evaluate the models.

## Analysis (trojan_detection_analysis.py)
- Run the trojan_detection_analysis.py script to analyze the hardware data and perform feature selection:

   ```bash
   python trojan_detection_analysis.py

Review the generated analysis results, including feature correlation heatmap and model evaluation metrics.
